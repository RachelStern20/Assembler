# Assembler
University project - Final C course project Grade 98.
This project represents an assembler for a custom machine with 4096 bytes and 8 registers. Every byte has 15 bits.

files:

  * assembler.c (Miriam & Racheli) - Contains the main function ,opens and closes input files and if input files arevalid creates output files.
    
  * pre_processor.c (Racheli) - Contains pre processor function witch macros and check macro validation.

  * first_pass.c (Miriam) - Contains functions witch go over input and checks validation according to project's inst.
    and if invalid reports error and moves on to next line. Puts valid info into dedicated Structers.

  * inst_error_check.c (Racheli) - Contains functions that check istruction input.

  * second_pass.c (Miriam & Racheli) - Goes over structers from first pass to check errors of entry and extern lables.

  * header files - Contains declarations of functions and structers in c files.

structers:

  * lable: contains lable name, lable address- address in witch lable is containd in memorey , lable type -before
    command or instructions.

  * codeword: a 15 bit bitfield for the codeing of the instruction input.

  * unknown_lables-  struct for lables that are used in command in firstpass contains: name, index - number index in
    codeword arr that code is not known ,line_num the line inwitch the lable is present.

  * entry_l - struct for lables declare as entry contains: lable name ,line in witch is declaired

  * command instructions data are kept in a int array that contains the data input numbers or the chars. Chars are
    containd in there ascii number.
